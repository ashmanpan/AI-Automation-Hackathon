## ⚠️ Backend Deployment - Needs Adjustment

The backend deployment to AWS App Runner failed during health check. This is a common issue and easily fixable.

### Issue
App Runner tried to access `/api/health` but the endpoint might not be properly configured or the database connection failed during startup.

### Solution Options

#### Option 1: Fix Health Endpoint (Recommended)

Check if the backend has a health endpoint:

```bash
cd /home/kpanse/wsl-myprojects/CiscoSP-Hackathon/backend
grep -r "health" src/
```

If missing, add this to `backend/src/server.ts`:

```typescript
// Health check endpoint
app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    status: 'ok',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  })
})
```

Then rebuild and redeploy.

#### Option 2: Deploy Without Health Check

Modify the deployment script to remove health check temporarily:

Edit `deploy-backend-aws.sh` and remove the `--health-check-configuration` section, then run:

```bash
./deploy-backend-aws.sh
```

#### Option 3: Use ECS Fargate Instead

App Runner can be finicky. ECS Fargate is more robust for production. I can create a script for that if needed.

## 🔧 Quick Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Add Health Endpoint

```bash
cd /home/kpanse/wsl-myprojects/CiscoSP-Hackathon/backend/src
```

Create or update `backend/src/routes/health.ts`:

```typescript
import { Router } from 'express'

const router = Router()

router.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    status: 'ok',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    service: 'hackathon-backend'
  })
})

export default router
```

Update `backend/src/server.ts` to include:

```typescript
import healthRouter from './routes/health'

// Add before other routes
app.use('/api', healthRouter)
```

### Step 2: Rebuild and Push

```bash
cd /home/kpanse/wsl-myprojects/CiscoSP-Hackathon/backend

# Rebuild Docker image
docker build -t hackathon-backend . --platform linux/amd64

# Push to ECR
export AWS_PROFILE=new-sept2025-runon
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | \
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin \
  567097740753.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

docker tag hackathon-backend:latest \
  567097740753.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hackathon-backend:latest

docker push \
  567097740753.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hackathon-backend:latest
```

### Step 3: Redeploy

```bash
./deploy-backend-aws.sh
```

## 📊 Current Architecture

```
✅ Frontend (Amplify)
    ↓
❌ Backend (App Runner) - FAILED, needs fix
    ↓
✅ RDS PostgreSQL - Ready
✅ S3 Storage - Ready
```

---

## 🎯 What's Working Right Now

1. **Frontend is LIVE** at https://main.d1bik9cnv8higc.amplifyapp.com
2. **Database is READY** for connections
3. **S3 bucket is READY** for file uploads
4. **Docker image is BUILT** and in ECR
5. **Continuous deployment is CONFIGURED**

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Manual Backend Fix

If you want to quickly fix the backend without redeploying:

1. Check backend logs to see exact error
2. Ensure database migrations are run
3. Verify environment variables are correct

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Quick Testing:
- Deploy frontend only (already done ✅)
- Use mock data in frontend temporarily
- Test all frontend functionality

### For Production:
- Fix health endpoint (5 minutes)
- Redeploy backend (10 minutes)
- Run database migrations
- Test complete flow

## 📋 Resources Created (Total Cost: ~$50/month)

| Resource | Status | Monthly Cost |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Frontend (Amplify) | ✅ RUNNING | $5 |
| Backend (App Runner) | ❌ FAILED | $0 (not running) |
| RDS PostgreSQL | ✅ RUNNING | $15 |
| S3 Bucket | ✅ READY | $3 |
| ECR Registry | ✅ READY | $1 |

**Current Cost:** ~$25/month (until backend is deployed)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Add health endpoint** to backend code (see above)
2. **Rebuild Docker image**
3. **Push to ECR**
4. **Run deployment script**
5. **Test complete application**

OR

Contact me to:
- Switch to ECS Fargate deployment
- Deploy backend to EC2
- Use Lambda + API Gateway instead

**Would you like me to:**
1. Add the health endpoint and redeploy?
2. Switch to ECS Fargate?
3. Try a different deployment method?

Let me know and I'll fix it right away! 🚀

# Hackathon Projects

This directory contains all submitted hackathon projects. Each team's project should be in its own subdirectory.

## 📁 Directory Structure

```
projects/
├── example-project/          # Template and example
├── team-awesome/             # Example team project
├── ai-wizards/              # Example team project
└── your-team-name/          # Your project goes here!
```

## 🚀 Creating Your Project

### Step 1: Create Your Directory

```bash
cd projects/
mkdir your-team-name
cd your-team-name
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Project

You can either:

**Option A: Copy the example template**
```bash
cp -r ../example-project/* .
# Then customize the files
```

**Option B: Start from scratch**
```bash
# Create your own structure
mkdir src tests docs
touch README.md requirements.txt .env.example
```

### Step 3: Build Your Project

Follow the guidelines in the main [README](../README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 📋 Project Requirements

Every project must include:

1. **README.md** - Complete project documentation
